        <h1 class="text-3xl my-3">1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
        <p class="text-justify">The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents that allows them to be manipulated and accessed by various scripting languages like JavaScript. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree; that way, programming languages can interact with the page. Every object in the DOM is hierarchically under another object, and any object can have multiple children but only one parent. In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.</p>
        <h1 class="text-3xl my-3">2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1>
        <p class="text-justify">I can select HTML elements using the DOM by calling methods such as getElementsByTagName(), getElementsByClassName(), getElementById(), querySelector(), or querySelectorAll() on the document object.</p>
        <h1 class="text-3xl my-3">3. What is event bubble?</h1>
        <p class="text-justify">Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy. In event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements. This process continues until the event reaches the document object, at which point the event "bubbles" up and is stopped.</p>
        <h1 class="text-3xl my-3">4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
        <p class="text-justify">A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. It is often used to provide additional functionality to the original function. Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after the task has completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and errors.</p>
